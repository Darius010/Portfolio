												Danish Certification Programme consolidated with a new fresh look!

										<p>
											The Danish Gambling Authority (Spillemyndigheden) published an updated version of the Certification Programme (Version 2.1) that came into effect on the 01st of October 2023. To those of us who are a little more obsessively inclined, this came as a huge relief as it addressed some very important inconsistencies between the Danish and English versions of the Version 2.0 standards (01/01/2023). 

										</p>
										<p>
											However, there is no reason for alarm on behalf of suppliers, operators or certification bodies. The updated version held no changes to the actual requirements set forth in version 2.0. What was the update all about then? In short – the visual layout of the document had been updated and minor linguistic corrections were made. The biggest update however was the inclusion of Standard 3.2.3, Use of electronic ID, in the English version of the Inspection Standards documents. This new standard had already been introduced in Version 2.0 of the Danish Gambling standards, however they were never included in the English version of the document, as published by the Regulator.
										</p>
										<p>
											This may have caused English and Danish inconsistencies in standard numbering when it came to Inspection reports, but as is the case with most jurisdictions – only the original language (Danish) version is legally binding. The English language counterpart only serves as guidance. 

										</p>

										<p>
											As far as regulatory frameworks go, Denmark is a personal guilty pleasure! The Danish Certification Programme is an unambiguous, clearly defined set of regulations with report templates provided by the Regulator. I commend the Danish Gambling Authority for the time, effort and thought that has been put into their certification programme. In terms of the requirements set forth in the programme, it is all well-worded, categorized and leaves minimal room for interpretation error. 
										</p>

										<p>
											The programme itself boasts with an easy-to-navigate document identifier numbering and naming convention. All testing and inspection standard documents are labelled with an “SCP” (Spillemyndigheden’s Certification Programme) prefix. Thereafter, a logical numbering system is used to identify the type of document, ranging from “00” to “06”. A second set of two digits are appended to further indicate the type of game covered in the document, ranging from “00” to “08”. See summary list below:
										</p>

										<p>
											Document type (SCP.xx.00)</br>
											"00" - General requirements </br>
											"01" - Testing standards</br>
											"02" - Inspection standards</br>
											"03" - Information Security Management System</br>
											"04" - Penetration Testing</br>
											"05" - Vulnerability Scanning</br>
											"06" - Change Management Programme</br>
										</p>

										<p>
											Game type (SCP.00.xx) </br>
											"00" - All types of games </br>
											"01" - Online betting </br>
											"02" - Land-based betting</br>
											"03" - Online casino</br>
											"04" - Charitable lotteries </br>
											"05" - Land-based casino</br>
											"06" - Lottery </br>
											"07" - Class lottery </br>
											"08" - Gaming machines with cash prizes</br>

											As for the casino-game specific regulations governing online gambling in this market, nothing too unique is required. Some of the most noticeable requirements are that gaming rounds shall last at least three seconds (from game initiation until account settlement), the user interface shall have a clock on display (independent from the user’s equipment) at all times, the base game version shall be in Danish, with the account balance and game currency clearly visible at all times (default to Danish Krone). The license holder shall at all times have the Danish Gambling Authority’s label on its website’s homepage (and subsequent pages) or user interface. With great respect, and caution – the rest of the requirements are pretty standard to ones found in other markets, tailored to Denmark. Important to note for this jurisdiction is the annual recertification specifications. Thankfully, the Spillemyndigheden considered the logistical nightmare that is recertification and allowed for retesting to be done via sampling, spot checks and compliancy with requirement set out in SCP06.00.DK- Change Management Programme.  
										</p>

										<p>
											I am quite excited to see what the future of online gambling holds for this well-developed jurisdiction. Compliments to the Danish Gambling Authority for a mint presentation of what online gambling regulation can, and should, look like.
