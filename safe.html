												The importance of the much-dreaded Control Database (CBD) across numerous Regulated Jurisdictions

										<p>
											As per the title, one of the most significant (and feared) systems that are to be implemented by Operators is a SAFE (Control Database). These normally consist of a data capturing and data storage (and reporting) system that is notorious for its ability to send Operators in a tailspin. Whether it is for Denmark, Spain, Netherlands or Greece (among many others), the development and implementation of a well-defined Control Database is of utmost importance. 
										</p>

										<p>
											To understand the significance of SAFE systems, one must take a moment to analyse the uses of such a system, in turn this can shed light on why these systems are so closely and stringently regulated in numerous markets. 		
										</p>

										<p>
											One of the biggest motivators behind the concept of CBD’s is the need to combat Money Laundering. From the early onset of online gambling the risk of Money Laundering has been absolutely apparent. As such, Regulators found that an uncorruptible (tamper-proof to some extent) system such as CDB’s are the ideal solution to not only identify and prevent money laundering, fraud and tax non-compliance on the account of the Operator, by having an auditable system of deposits, withdrawals and Operator Totals in place. But furthermore, to identify, prevent and combat these issues at individual player level as well. 
										</p>

										<p>
											This is by no means the full extent of the usefulness of CBD’s as they are also used to controlled other Regulated aspects in different jurisdictions. The effort to combat irresponsible gambling on behalf of patrons across the world will forever be one of the main duties of Regulators and Operators alike. SAFE systems are required to record all manner of data for each transaction made by the player, and with access to such large amount of data it became possible for Operators to ensure greater control over Responsible Gambling as a whole. The data captured and stored allows Operators to monitor and implement:
									</br>	•	Self-exclusion conditions 
									</br>	•	Player patterns with customer harm risks
									</br>	•	Session limits 
									</br>	•	Tax compliance on taxable wins where applicable
									</br>	•	Coercion and other illegal/fraudulent behaviour
										</p>

										<p>
											Additionally, Control Databases are useful sources for market data and analysis. Market size data and expenditure data are also made available to Regulators to monitor and conduct harm prevention gambling research. 
										</p>

										<p>
											Considering the above, which is by no means an exhaustive list of CBD uses, it is easier to understand the strict regulation of these databases by Regulators, and the importance of Operators to comply and avoid any form of non-compliance when it comes to the design, implementation and regular maintenance of such systems across all jurisdictions where required. 
										</p>

										<p>
											As intimidating as it all appears, it is important to note that most Regulators have established very clear and concise ‘blueprints’ for these systems, and countless Operators have been able to successfully implement these systems for years already. Yes, the initial effort into design and establishment of a SAFE is daunting and requires significant resources, but once correctly established and implemented, Operators will enjoy the accessibility of various data points and the ease of compliance in this regard when it comes to recertification and maintenance.
